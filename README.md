This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## To Install Application

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- For Windows:

    On the top right corner of the URL, you can see a download icon, click on it and hit install to download on your local computer.
    to uninstall the app click on the three dots in the top right corner of the app and select uninstall.

- For Android:

    To install the app in android there are two ways to do it based on the URL you use.

       1. If you are using a URL that is generated after the build, then use that URL to open in a mobile browser(chrome). Then go to settings and select the option 'Add to home screen'  this will add the application to the mobile device.

       2.  another way is if you are running the app local just like [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), then use your system IPaddress: 3000 to open the app and install. (like Ex:http://192.34.1.46:3000), then use that URL to open in a mobile browser(chrome). Then go to settings and select the option 'Add to home screen'  this will add the application to the mobile device.

- For iPhone:

    To install the app on an iPhone use safari browser only, open the link and click on the bottom middle share icon, scroll down and select add to home screen. this will add the application to the device.
